<p>After a little while coding in Python every day for my work, I needed to make a break and perform some R analysis! Since the beginning of my postdoc, I haven’t followed the last trends concerning R packages. In this post, I am going to analyze some data about R packages to see what are the most downloaded packages during the past weeks. I will also visualize all the relationships between the R packages by looking at their required dependencies.</p>
<p>Let’s import the packages required for this analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(cranlogs)
library(igraph)
library(visNetwork)</code></pre>
<div id="how-to-find-the-most-popular-r-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>How to find the most popular R packages ?</h1>
<p>The first thing is to gather the data about the number of downloads for each package. Luckily for us, there is a package called <em>cranlogs</em> that does just what we need ! With a simple line of command we can collect data about the 50 packages with the most downloads in the last month, we can then plot the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>popular_pckg &lt;- cran_top_downloads(&quot;last-month&quot;, 50)

popular_pckg %&gt;%
  mutate(package = fct_reorder(package, desc(count))) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = package, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + 
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(&quot;&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Downloads&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 9, face = &quot;bold&quot;),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +labs(x = NULL)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2022-07-19-analysis-of-the-top-r-packages.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I thought this graph will be harder to make because of the availability of the data but with the right package everything can be done !</p>
</div>
<div id="visualisation-of-the-dependencies-between-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Visualisation of the dependencies between packages</h1>
<p>Once I saw the above graph, I was wondering about all the dependencies between these packages and I wanted to know which one was the most “connected”. To answer this question, I need more data, especially about the required dependencies of each package. After some research, I found out that data about package (including description and dependencies) can be extracted with a function in the <em>tools</em> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_pkg &lt;- tools::CRAN_package_db()[, c(&#39;Package&#39;, &#39;Description&#39;, &#39;Imports&#39;)]</code></pre>
<p>However, this function extract the data for all the packages and I want to perform the analysis only on the top 100 popular packages. So I decided to couple the function of the <em>cranlog</em> package with the database I collected with the <code>CRAN_package_db()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Can be quite long hence the parallel map
plan(multisession, workers = 12)
monthly_dl &lt;- future_map(df_pkg$Package, function(x){sum(cran_downloads(x, &#39;last-month&#39;)$count)})
df_pkg$monthly_dl &lt;- unlist(monthly_dl)
# write_csv(df_pkg, &#39;R_pkg_dl.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We can then filter by number of downloads and keep only the top 100:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_pkg &lt;- df_pkg %&gt;% 
  distinct(Package, .keep_all= TRUE) %&gt;% 
  arrange(monthly_dl) %&gt;% 
  top_n(100, monthly_dl)</code></pre>
<p>Now, it is time to prepare the data for a graph visualization. To make a graph, we need two tables. The first one must contain all the relationships between nodes (in our case nodes are packages), it has two columns : ‘from’ and ‘to’. The second table contains only one column with the names of the nodes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>import_cleaning &lt;- function(text){
  text &lt;- gsub(&#39;\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)&#39;, &#39;&#39;, text)
  text &lt;- gsub(&#39;\\n&#39;, &#39; &#39;, text)
  text &lt;- gsub(&#39; &#39;, &#39;&#39;, text, fixed = TRUE)
  text &lt;- str_split(text, &#39;,&#39;)
  return(text)
}

import_cleaning(df_pkg$Imports[2])

test &lt;- df_pkg %&gt;% 
  mutate(cleaned_imports = import_cleaning(Imports))

df_target &lt;- function(x,y){
  df &lt;- expand.grid(from=x, to=unlist(y))
  return(df)}

for(i in 1:nrow(test)){
  if(i == 1){
    df_res = df_target(test$Package[i], test$cleaned_imports[i])
  }else{
      df_res = rbind(df_res, df_target(test$Package[i], test$cleaned_imports[i]))
  }
}

links &lt;- df_res %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(to) | (to == &quot;&quot;))

nodes &lt;- tibble(id=as.character(unique(unlist(df_res))))</code></pre>
<p>Once the two matrices are made, we can interactively visualize the graph network with <em>visNetwork</em> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>visNetwork(nodes, links) %&gt;%
    visIgraphLayout(type = &quot;full&quot;) %&gt;%
    visNodes(
        shape = &quot;dot&quot;,
        color = list(
            background = &quot;#0085AF&quot;,
            border = &quot;#013848&quot;,
            highlight = &quot;#FF8000&quot;
        ),
        scaling = list(min=2,
                       max = 10),
        shadow = list(enabled = TRUE, size = 10)
    ) %&gt;%
    visEdges(
      arrows=&#39;to&#39;,
        shadow = FALSE,
        color = list(color = &quot;#0085AF&quot;, highlight = &quot;#C62F4B&quot;)
    ) %&gt;%
    visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = T, degree = 1, hover = T)) %&gt;% 
    visLayout(randomSeed = 11)</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="visNetwork html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json"
