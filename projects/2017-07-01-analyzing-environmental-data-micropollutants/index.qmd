## Summary

The aim of this work was to provide a descriptive synthesis of the physical and climatic forcings of the Adour (a french river) plume, namely swell, wind and flow. This synthesis aims to estimate the initial parameters of a hydrodynamic model of the Adour plume, which will be used to better better understand the transport of micropollutants in this estuary.
