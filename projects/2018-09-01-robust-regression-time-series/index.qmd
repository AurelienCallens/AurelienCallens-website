## Summary 

During this internship, I worked on a new statistical method to perform robust regression for time series exhibiting heteroscedasticity. We developed and tested this method on a dataset containing chlorophyll concentration in a small tributary of the Thames River (UK). 

## Productions
 
- **My Master 2 Thesis**:
  + <a href="/doc/Master_thesis_2_Callens_Aurelien.pdf" target="_blank"> Robust regression for time series exhibiting heterogeneity</a>

- **Developement in the `rlmDataDriven` package**: 
    + `rlmDD_het.R` : this function performs a robust regression which accounts for temporal correlations and heterogeneity.
    + `whm.R` : this function is the R implementation of the weighted M-estimation. 

- **A published paper in a reviewed journal**:
