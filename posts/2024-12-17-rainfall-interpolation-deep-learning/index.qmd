Once again, I published a new article on Medium! This time I explore an exciting challenge in agriculture and meteorology: Can we achieve the accuracy of rain gauges while benefiting from the broad coverage of remote sensing? ðŸŒ§ðŸ“¡

### Why does spatial rainfall data matter?

Rainfall influences everything from irrigation planning to crop health management. While traditional rain gauges provide highly accurate, localized measurements, they donâ€™t capture rainfall patterns across larger regionsâ€”creating blind spots for decision-making. Weather radars and satellites help fill these gaps, but their estimates of ground-level rainfall lack precision.

### The challenge and our approach

At Sencrop, weâ€™re tackling this challenge with deep learning. In this post, I introduce an innovative methodology called densification, which merges:
- Sparse but precise rainfall observations from our weather station network
- Dense but less accurate rainfall estimates from radar and satellite data

The goal? Provide high-resolution (1kmÂ²) rainfall data anywhere in Europe, with accuracy equal to or better than our station network.

Curious to see how weâ€™re making this a reality? Check out the full article here: [Rainfall with a precision of 1kmÂ²: a myth becoming reality?](https://medium.com/science-engineering-at-sencrop/rainfall-with-a-precision-of-1km%C2%B2-a-myth-becoming-reality-ee97f440c148)
