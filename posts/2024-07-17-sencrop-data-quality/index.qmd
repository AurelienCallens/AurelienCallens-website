Long time no see! I‚Äôve been busy settling into my new position, but I‚Äôm back with a fresh article on Medium. üöÄ

When working with weather data, ensuring data quality is not just a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Weather forecasts, decision-support tools, and climate analyses all rely on accurate measurements. But what happens when a sensor malfunctions, a station is installed incorrectly, or‚Äîbelieve it or not‚Äîa bird decides to nest in a rain collector? üê¶

At Sencrop, the network of weather stations fuels a variety of downstream processes, from simple aggregations to complex agricultural decision-making tools. Without robust anomaly detection, these processes could be thrown off by faulty measurements, leading to inaccurate insights.

In this article, I explore:

- Why data quality control matters in meteorology
- Common  data quality control methods and why they are not adapted to our case
- How we implement an inovative anomaly detection to keep our data reliable
