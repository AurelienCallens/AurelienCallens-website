My name is Aurélien Callens, and I'm passionate about data science, coding… and fishing! After completing a PhD in applied mathematics focused on coastal risk modeling, I continued my journey in an AgTech startup, leading R&D projects in geospatial data fusion and deep learning for meteorology.

As a freelance Data Scientist, I leverage my expertise in data analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to help businesses unlock the full potential of their data. Whether working with environmental, geospatial, or industrial data, I support my clients from research to industrialization, transforming data into impactful and innovative solutions.
