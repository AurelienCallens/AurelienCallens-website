      <description>After a little while coding in Python everyday for my work, I needed to make a break and perform some R analysis! Since the beginning of my postdoc, I haven’t followed the last trends concerning R package. In this post, I am going to analyze some data about R package to see what are the most downloaded R package during the past weeks. I will also visualize all the relationships between the R package by looking at their required dependencies.</description>

      <description>In this post, I explore the data I have collected during the last year with the updated version of the application (presented here). This quick exploratory analysis is performed with two packages I really enjoy: Plotly and shiny.
For reminder, my new application store the data in three csv files. The first one contains variables related to the fishing conditions. The second one contains information about my catches and finally the third one contains information about the characteristics of the lures I used during the session.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I defended my thesis entitled ‘Statistical learning for coastal risks assessment’ in front of an academic jury. The defense went extremely well and the the jury and the auditory were genuinely interested by the work I had done during my thesis. For me, this thesis was an amazing and enriching journey in terms of knowledge and research, but also in terms of collaboration and exchange. I now am excited to start a new journey and discover new subjects to work on !</description>

      <description>In this previous post, I presented the shiny application I developed to record data about my fishing session. In today’s post, I will present briefly the changes and updates I made to improve the application. Here are the main changes :
 Weather API: the API I was using (Dark Sky) stopped furnishing free data. I changed for Openweathermap and I needed to update the functions to gather the same information as before.</description>

      <description>I am currently in my third year of PhD and it is time for me to synthesize all the work I have done by writing my thesis. One important step is the introduction which presents the general context and the contributions of my thesis in the research world. For my introduction, I decided to include the Google trend analysis of specific terms related to my PhD subject. For information, the aim of my PhD is to demonstrate the potential contributions of statistical learning methods in the study of coastal risk.</description>

      <description>Today, I am going to show you how to scrape product prices from Aliexpress website.
A few words on web scraping Before diving into the subject, you should be aware that web scraping is not allowed on certain websites. To know if it is the case for the website you want to scrape, I invit you to check the robots.txt page which should be located at the root of the website adress.</description>

      <description>In the previous blog article, I described in details how I built a shiny application that stores data about my fishing sessions. In this post, I will explore the data I have collected during the last year.
To sum up, my application store the data in two csv files. The first one contains variables related to the fishing conditions at the beginning and at the end of the session such as :</description>

      <description>My favorite hobby, in addition to R coding of course, is fishing. Most of the time, I am fishing European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in estuaries. The sea bass is a predatory fish that has a broad range of preys: crabs, sand eels, prawns, shrimps and other fish. To catch these predators, I don’t use live baits, I prefer to use artificial lures that imitate a specific prey.
In theory, it is quite easy to catch a fish:</description>

      <description>Here, I will present my projects and write articles on different subjects such as :
 Statistcal analysis Data visualisation Shiny applications Web scrapping etc …  All these articles will include R code and examples. Python users won’t be left aside as I am currently learning this language!</description>
